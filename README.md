This was a quiz built using pure javascript. It has a timer that decrements once per second and resets for each new question. This particular timer was made by looping three functions and checking for a loss state once per loop. This quiz keeps track of right and wrong answers and displays results at the end of the quiz. It also has a question randomizer that pushes the question objects from one array to another in a random order so that the questions appear in a different order every time you play. The reset button simply refreshes the page. I also toyed a little with the z-axis(for pictures) and text-shadow effects in CSS.
